## Intro
Just a quick tool for getting an mp3 file from a text source. Such source must be filled from the `input-text.json` file.

The converter will put the resulting `.mp3` file using the file name proposed in the file.

The project is based on the `gtts` python module, so use the conventions on the language part.
